        <h1 class="ranked-title">Ranked Mode</h1>

        <p class="info-text">

            Ranked mode is built around strategic decision-making from both sides –
            from thoughtful build choices to tactics and moment-to-moment actions.
            <br><br>

            Survivors must become a true team, working in perfect coordination
            to achieve victory – while the Killer must rise as a relentless threat.
            <br><br>

            In Ranked Mode, Survivors can choose from <b>4 distinct roles</b>,
            each providing unique advantages. Choose wisely, based on your playstyle and strengths.
            <br><br>

            <i>Enjoy your suffering in the Fog.</i>

        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Gameplay</h2>

        <div class="gameplay-text">

            At the beginning of a match, both sides block 3 perks for their opponents – one from each category.
            Survivors restrict Hex, Generator Regression and Blocking perks, while the Killer blocks Exhaustion, Boon and Second Chance perks.

            <br><br>

            After that, both sides have 60 seconds to finalize their builds.

            <br><br>

            The match then proceeds to the map veto phase – each side alternately bans 4 realms and then selects 2 from the remaining ones.
            One realm is chosen at random from the 4 selected, along with a random variation if available.

            <br><br>

            During the trial, both sides earn rating points based on their performance and in-game actions.

            <br><br>

            The final outcome is determined by comparing the Killer’s total rating points
            to the total rating points of all Survivors.

            <br><br>

            More details can be found in the Survivor / Killer rule sections.

        <section class="ranking-section">

            <div class="ranking-text">
                There are 6 ranks in total – five of them are divided into subranks,
                from IV to I.
                <br><br>
                Each subrank requires 100 rating points to progress.
                <br><br>
                The sixth rank stands above the rest – it is not just simply progression,
                but the ultimate goal – to become the perfect servant of the Entity.
